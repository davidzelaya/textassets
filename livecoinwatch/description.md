Decred can be described as an open-source, community-based cryptocurrency, much like Bitcoin. It is designed as a hybrid between the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocols, these hybridized protocol systems can also be referred to as Proof-of-Activity protocols.

Decred first began in February of 2016 and was launched by the same Bitcoin developers that engineered btcsuite; an alternate full-node Bitcoin implementation written in the Go programming language and is employed by development projects like Ethereum, Factom, BitGo, OpenBazaar, and the more recent Lightning Network.
