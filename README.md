This repository hosts text assets for various platforms where Decred is represented.

Having all texts in one place allows to quickly identify outdated texts with a simple text search. For example, query [`forum`](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets/search?q=forum&type=Code) shows which sites still link to the forum, or the exact match [`"mainnet.decred.org"`](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets/search?q=%22mainnet.decred.org%22&type=Code) shows which sites still link to the old Insight-based block explorer. Both sites are now deprecated.

This repo also allows to use GitHub features to discuss and collaborate on future changes before implementing them. Most captured platforms don't offer such workflows.
