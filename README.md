This repository hosts text assets for various platforms where Decred is represented.

Having all texts in one place allows to quickly find outdated texts using a simple text search. For example, query [`forum`](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets/search?q=forum&type=Code) shows which sites still link to the disabled forum, exact match [`"mainnet.decred.org"`](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets/search?q=%22mainnet.decred.org%22&type=Code) shows which sites still link to the old Insight-based explorer, and [`activity`](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets/search?q=activity&type=Code) shows places that are confused about Decred's relation with [Proof of Activity](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/39).

This repo also allows to use GitHub features to discuss and collaborate on future changes before implementing them. Most platforms tracked here don't offer such workflows.

What you can do:

- To inspect a given site, open its directory and check the files. `profile.yml` is a special master file that has the exact link to Decred's page and basic text data captured from it.
- To propose a change or sync with external changes, create a pull request.
- For small issues internal to this repository, create an issue [here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/textassets/issues).
  - e.g. to propose a fix to data or a change to its format.
- For bigger issues with larger impact, use the general community [issue tracker](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues).
  - e.g. to create a task for negotiating a change with external parties.
