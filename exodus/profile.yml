description: Decred addresses cryptocurrency problems like conflicts of interest, inefficient governance, and chain splits. DCR is self-funded, governed by stakeholders who are incentivized to vote with DCR rewards, and has a clear governance model that prevents long disputes that can lead to splits. DCR also plans to add features like Lightning Network, private transactions, and more.
