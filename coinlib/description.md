Decred (DCR) is a fork of Bitcoin that was launched in February 2016 by Company 0 with the goal of improving upon its predecessor through open governance and emphasis on community input and with added sustainable funding for future development. It uses a combination of Proof of Work (POW) and Proof of Stake (POS) to avoid the concentration of power on a small group of miners. Decred empowers users who donâ€™t own mining equipment to participate in network consensus by acting as a check on ners through its internal voting mechanism. 60% of block rewards go to the POW miners, while 30% goes to DCR holders who participated in POS voting. The remaining 10% goes to its Treasury Fund, which is allotted for development initiatives.
