After a proposal for new suite of features to be added to Bitcoin from Company 0 was rejected by the Bitcoin core team. Named btcsuite, The Company 0 team left the Bitcoin project and created Decred.

Decred’s governance and consensus mechanism relies on a PoW/Proof-of-Stake (PoS) hybrid, which the project regards as a sort of “second authentication factor for consensus” by enabling coin holders to curb potential miner centralization, Decred employs a governance body called the Politeia to guide the project’s direction and fund operations from its treasury.

The treasury is funded via a block subsidy representing 10% of each block reward. To obtain funds proposals are made to the Politeia which votes to either approve or reject the proposal. Once approved the funding for a proposal is released from the treasury dependent on achievement of agreed upon milestones.

The block subsidy was instituted because all enhancements to Bitcoin are dependent on third party funding which the Decred team feels introduces conflicts of interest. Instituting block subsidies is viewed as a preferable option because it makes funds readily available for project enhancements.  Spending on enhancements is conducted transparently via the governance mechanisms of the Politeia.

Holders of the projects native token, DCR, can earn block rewards by staking their tokens in exchange for tickets. The rewards mechanism functions like a lottery, assigning the block reward randomly to ticket holders. To bring greater certainty to earning rewards many users choose to assign their tokens to a staking pool. Which obtains tickets en mass using participants pledged DCR holdings increasing the chances of pool participants receiving rewards.
