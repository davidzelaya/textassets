Decred preserves some core features of Bitcoin’s codebase (e.g. supply cap), but introduces a plethora of unique features, including replacing SHA256 with BLAKE256, utilizing an elliptic curve (secp256k1) which allows Schnorr signatures integration, and building a PoW-PoS hybrid consensus mechanism. 

Decred also deploys a novel block reward scheme by splitting rewards between a PoW miner (60%) and typically 5 PoS voters (30%) with the remaining 10% allocated to development subsidy. Block rewards are reduced by a factor of 100/101 every 6,144 blocks, approximately 21 days. Decred investors can become voting stakeholders by purchasing tickets and voting on a Decred block confirmation via a lottery ticket-selection process. A simple majority is necessary to add a block.

On September 19, 2017 Decred completed its first successful cross-chain atomic swap with Litecoin. A critical first step in building the decentralized exchange it intends to roll out in the future.

Decred is actively pursuing integration with the Lightning network. So users can initiate payments across Bitcoin’s network with its native token DCR and potentially hold multiple assets in Decredition, the Decred wallet solution. Additional steps required to release the decentralized exchange they are focused on building.

Currently, the project is adding support for Decentralized Autonomous Entities, DAEs, of which the Politeia is the first example. So users can band together with like-minded individuals to create organizations to support their missions.
