usage_details: DCR is used as a native currency within the Decred network. DCR can be used for peer-to-peer payments and value storage within the Decred network. Through staking DCR users can receive tickets, a non-tradable cryptoasset on the Decred network, to participate in the POS consensus and Decred governance. Each block 5 tickets are randomly selected by a Poisson distribution to validate blocks produced by POW miners, and vote on Decred governance proposals during voting periods.
