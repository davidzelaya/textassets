tagline: a community-directed cryptocurrency with on-chain governance
sector: Currencies
category: Payments
overview: Decred is a hybrid proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) cryptocurrency with a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development. It utilizes its hybrid consensus and on-chain governance systems to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the input of the community. The project funds its own development from a decentralized treasury.
