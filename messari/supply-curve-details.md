New blocks are mined every 5 minutes. The block reward was initially set at 31.19582664 DCR and halves every 6,144 blocks (approximately 21 days). The reward reduction rate is set at 100/101. Block rewards are allocated to three distinct groups:

- 60% is allocated to the Proof-of-Work miner
- 30% is allocated to the Proof-of-Stake voters. Each of the 5 voters receive 6% of the block reward
- 10% is allocated to the Decred Treasury

If a block includes less than 5 Proof-of-Stake votes, a fraction of the block reward is not allocated. As a result, the maximum supply only indicates an upper limit for the total number of decred which will ever be created, as the actual precise issuance depends on how many Proof-of-Stake votes are included in each block.

The supply is capped at 21,000,000 DCR and the last block reward is set for January 2039.
