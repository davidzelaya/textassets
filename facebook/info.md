Decred is an open and progressive cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain.

The Project is based on the Decred Constitution, which contains core principles such as finite issuance, privacy, security, fungibility, inclusivity, and progressive development of the technology.

* Technology:

Hybrid proof-of-work proof-of-stake consensus system to strike a balance between miners and voters and create a more robust notion of consensus. Written entirely in Go using a modular, well-documented, and tested codebase for long-term maintainability.

* Development:

Multi-stakeholder development ecosystem that welcomes and empowers participants who want to propose new or improve on existing features. Open and self-funded development via a block subsidy to ensure long-term development sustainability as project and network usage scale upward – Decred improves with use.

* Governance:

Layered form of open-source governance that extends beyond proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms to bring forward and represent insider and outsider voices in the community. Bottom-up decision-making through the Decred Assembly – an evolving and inclusive list of community members who make non-financial contributions to the project through their work and effort.
