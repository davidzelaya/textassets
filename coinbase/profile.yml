description: "Decred is a cryptocurrency that combines two consensus models: proof of work and proof of stake. When new blocks are mined, 60% of the block reward goes to proof of work miners, 30% to proof of stake voters, and 10% to fund development of the protocol. Stakeholders may also vote on changes to the protocol itself."
