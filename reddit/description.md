Decred is a community-directed digital currency designed to be a superior store of value for generations to come.
Its hybrid PoW+PoS consensus mechanism, transparent proposal and voting system, and continually funded treasury, make it secure, adaptable, and self-sustaining.
Decred stakeholders collectively determine the policy, development plan, budget, changes to the consensus rules, and they approve the minersâ€™ work.
Each block reward compensates miners, stakeholders, and the Treasury.
