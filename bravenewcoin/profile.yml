summary: Decred is a cryptocurrency, similar to Bitcoin, with a strong focus on community input, open governance and sustainable funding and development. It utilizes a hybrid “proof-of-work” and “proof-of-stake” mining system to protect against attacks by ensuring that small groups cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the input of the community. A unit of currency is called a ‘decred’ (DCR).
