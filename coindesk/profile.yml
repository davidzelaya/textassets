about: The Decred project was started in 2016 by Company 0 and launched its mainne soon after. It was led by Jake Yocom-Piatt and other software developers who previously contributed to btcsuite. It forked bitcoin to enable a hybrid consensus system combining Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) into the novel Proof-of-Activity (PoA). The goal was to better organize the develop and decentralization of a cryptocurrency. 60% of block rewards goes to miners and 30% goes to stakeholders to allow for checks and balances. The final 10% is a subsidy to an autonomous treasury that disperses funding to projects based on voting through the blockchain.
