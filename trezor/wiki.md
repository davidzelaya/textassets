## Technology

### Consensus Mechanism

Proof-of Work and Proof-of-Stake are used to provide the consensus that confirms new blocks and transactions. This hybridized system is also referred to as Proof-of-Activity (PoA).

### Governance

Decred became the first cryptocurrency project to approve a change to its protocol through a binding on-chain vote. This changed the Proof of Stake staking algorithm to simplify the process of buying tickets. This change was contentious in the sense that participants in Proof of Work mining were incentivised to reject it because it decreased the fees they could expect to receive, but stakeholders (i.e. PoS Miners) were able to enforce their decision that it should be accepted.

- Project subsidy

Ten percent of the Decred block reward goes into a project subsidy wallet, to be used to fund development and promotion of the project.

### Atomic Swap

Decred developers executed an atomic swap between Decred (DCR) and Litecoin (LTC) in September 2017.
